   <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>

   <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

   <p>This is a recipe passed down from my Mom. Every time I make it, someone asks for the recipe. One friend says her family fights over it! I hope you enjoy! You can also make a homemade chicken soup with this recipe. Just cut up veggies, shred chicken, and cook in chicken broth.</p>
